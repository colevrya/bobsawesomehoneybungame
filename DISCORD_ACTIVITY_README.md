# Discord Activity Entry Path

Your website remains unchanged at its original index.html.

For Discord Activities, map your Activity URL to `/discord/index.html` on your production host (Cloudflare Pages/Workers).

No game code was altered; the Discord build is a copy of your main index with a minimal Embedded App SDK init that only runs when inside Discord.
